## Summary

From top starting and ending location, we found that most popular location for biking is near central park in NYC. Also, from Trips by weekdays per hour, we found that most bike-sharing users are male subscribers and mostly ride the bike during weekdays instead of weekend. Combining the results above, we can conclude that most users in bike-sharing program in NYC are locals instead of tourisms. Since the population density in NYC is high, bike sharing is a relatively inexpensive and convenience transportation. Therefore, the users mostly use bike as a transportation to go to work.

2.	The profit of bike-sharing programs vs bike repairing cost by month.
